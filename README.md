# Jack

Jack is command-line CD ripper. It extracts audio from a CD, encodes it using
3rd party software and augment it with metadata from various sources

As all CLI things, Jack (the ripper) is fast and efficient, and that's why we
like it.

This was a heavily modified fork of https://github.com/jack-cli-cd-ripper/jack
which had become obsolete, as it requires Python 2, and needs FreeDB which
has been declared dead.

However, the jack-cli-cd-ripper/jack has been revived, with the original author
and myself joining the organization

This fork has now been merged into the python3-mb branch of jack-cli-cd-ripper/jack
and therefore is now obsolete, and has been emptied.
